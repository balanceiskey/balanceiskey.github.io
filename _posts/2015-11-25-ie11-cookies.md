title: Internet Explorer 11 treats cookies unlike other modern browsers
---

If you're attempting to invalidate a cookie in IE 11 be sure to set the `expires` parameter. Unlike other modern browsers which can work just fine off of `max-age`, IE 11 (and apparently all its predecessors) don't respect it. 

To better understand the difference between `max-age` and `expires`, check out this [article](http://mrcoles.com/blog/cookies-max-age-vs-expires/) and handy [demo](http://mrcoles.com/media/test/cookies-max-age-vs-expires.html).
